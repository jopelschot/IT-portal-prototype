# IT-portal-prototype
Suggested front-end for IT portal Challenge 1 

The prototype is built as a web application, using the Springboot framework and Bootstrap.
Running the code will start a basic Tomcat server from your computer.
When the server is started, you can view the prototype from any internet browser. 
URL --> http://localhost:8080/

This will lead you to the index page, which is an image of Rabohub with an added IT support widget.
Clicking the page will direct you to the actual IT support page as shown in the presentation.
Note that this is just a front-end, and features like the searchbar do not have actual functionality.

For demonstration purposes:
  - Clicking the Outlook icon directs you to an image of outlook support.
  - Hovering the Dutch flag icon shows a tooltip mentioning translation of the page.
  - Hovering disrupted application icons shows a popover with more details.
  - Clicking the Nina button opens the Nina chatbox with a conversation. Here, you also cannot actively interact with Nina.
